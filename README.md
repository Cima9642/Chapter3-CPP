# Chapter 3 C++ COSC 1336
This program will solve the quadratic equation for variable x 

It addresses the following cases: 
* Two distinct real solutions (this is the "normal case") 
* Two distinct complex solution (discriminant is < 0) 
* One real solution (discriminant = 0) 
* One real solution (a = 0, so the equation to be solved is really just bx +c =0)
